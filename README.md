# A Hash Generator and Verifier

This is the source code for JHASH, a hash generator and verifier. It produces a variety of checksums including: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 and CRC32.

You can run the program using command prompt by compiling the java files found in the `com.js.jhash`. 

If you are using Eclipse as your IDE of choice, you can `git clone` the project and import using Eclipse. 

You can do whatever you want to do with this code BUT you must provide credit.
